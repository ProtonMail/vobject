[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ProtonMail/vobject/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=ARcwkxCKZn)](https://codecov.io/gh/ProtonMail/vobject)

Forked from [sabre/vobject](https://github.com/sabre-io/vobject).

The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)
and [vCard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350) objects using PHP.

The goal of the VObject library is to create a very complete library, with an easy-to-use API.

    composer require protonlabs/vobject "^4.0"

This package requires PHP 5.5. If you need the PHP 5.3/5.4 version of this package instead, use:
